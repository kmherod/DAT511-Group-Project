The Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset was built from recordings of 30 subjects performing daily living activities 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist with inertial sensors. The dataset consists of 10,299 instances collected 
using the accelerometer and gyroscope of the smartphone. Each subject within an age bracket of 19-48 years performed six activities: 
WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING. Sensor signals were captured at 50Hz and video-recorded to 
manually label the activities. The data was then split into a training set containing 70% of subjects and a test set containing 30% of subjects.

The purpose of using this data is to demonstrate our groups ability to collect, work with, and clean a dataset. The goal is to prepare 
tidy data that can be used for further analysis. 

- Variable Descriptions: Definitions for each variable or column in the dataset, including units and data types.



- Missing Data Handling: Explanation of how missing values were handled in the dataset.

Applying the command sum(is.na(merged_data)) prior to cleaning the merged dataset revealed that there are no missing values.

- Data Processing: Steps or code used to clean, transform, or manipulate the data.

- Code Instructions: Information on how to run the script and use the dataset.

- Analysis Description: Details of the analyses performed or planned.
